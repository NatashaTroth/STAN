## Start client (Port 3000)

## Start server (Port 5000)
With nodemon:

Without nodemon:

```cd server/ && npm start```

Apollo GraphQl playground:
http://localhost:5000/graphql

## Start client and server simultaneously (using concurrently)

## Other commands (not yet implemented)

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd client
  npm start

  -> npm install apollo-boost @apollo/react-hooks graphql
